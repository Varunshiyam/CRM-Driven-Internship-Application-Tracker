## 📌 Project Overview

**Internship Tracker & Skills Badge Manager** is a Salesforce-powered application designed to streamline the entire internship lifecycle — from application tracking, monitoring skill acquisition, to automating reminders and awarding achievement badges.

Built with **Lightning Web Components (LWC)** for a modern UI and comprehensive **Apex automation**, this system enables users to:

- Efficiently track internship applications, statuses, and company details.
- Receive automated reminders for application deadlines and skill milestones.
- Manage and prioritize skills development with interactive trackers.
- Earn badges recognizing skill achievements.
- Automate important email notifications triggered by system events.

This repository contains well-structured folders housing Apex classes, triggers, LWCs, object metadata, static resources, and essential docs.
